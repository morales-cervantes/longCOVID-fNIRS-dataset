---
This repository contains the **expanded version** of the functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) dataset and the complete **Python scripts** used for analyzing the neural correlates of postCOVID-19. The dataset consists of **29,737 time-series samples from 37 participants** (9 postCOVID-19, 28 controls). We applied several machine learning algorithms with and without dimensionality reduction to evaluate their performance in classifying long COVID patients.

## Contents

- `Long_COVID_fNIRS_Raw_Data/`: Raw fNIRS recordings (.tsv) from 37 participants (9 post-COVID, 28 controls).
- `data_processing/`: Python scripts for preprocessing, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification using six ML models.



## Methodology

- Acquisition: Brite MKII (Artinis), bilateral motor cortex, finger-tapping task.
- Preprocessing: time-series standardization, PCA (95% variance retained).
- Machine Learning:
  - **Time-series models**: direct use of 132-channel HbO features (per sample).
  - **PCA-based models**: reduced to 35 components.
  - **Statistical features**: 528 features per subject (mean, std, min, max), for comparison.
- Evaluation: 5-fold and 10-fold **stratified cross-validation** with metrics including:
  - Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV, and AUC-ROC.

## Key Findings

- Time-series models using **PCA** retained nearly perfect classification (up to 100% accuracy for KNN, MLP, RF, XGBoost).
- **Flattened statistical features** resulted in significantly lower sensitivity (<30%), highlighting the critical role of temporal dynamics.
- All scripts use standard Python libraries: `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`, `pandas`.

## Purpose

This project aims to promote reproducibility and encourage further research into **non-invasive, portable neuroimaging** tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of long COVID. The results support the development of robust biomarkers using fNIRS and machine learning.
